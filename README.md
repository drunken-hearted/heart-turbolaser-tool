> "Should I upgrade from the old one to this one?"
 
Yes, you probably should as this is more optimized and cleaner allowing for more performance, and less errors. Plus, if you're a server owner, your developers will have an easier time editing this.

> "I found an error/bug/unintended thing!"
 
Great! If you know how to fix it, chuck a pull request and i'll look into getting it merged. If you don't know how to fix it, report it in the github issues page or make a post in the steam forums. **(NOT THE COMMENTS)** Make sure to include as much detail as you can including your turbolaser settings aswell as how to recreate the issue!

> "Why does nothing happen when I click?"
 
If the tool detects any invalid values and you **DO NOT** get any errors, it will simply just not do anything. If this is happening to you, just simply go back to the default preset.
